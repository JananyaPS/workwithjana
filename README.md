1. CAR PRICE PREDICTION PROJECT:
Car price prediction is a machine learning project that uses decision tree regression algorithm- a supervised learning method employed to predict the price of car when the features of the car were provided.
It is a simple and basic machine learning project created to understand the working of machine learning algorithm and data preprocessing steps in a detailed way.

2.CUSTOMER LOAN PREDICTION:
Customer Loan Prediction is a machine learning project employed using Logistic Regression algorithm- a supervised learning method which classifies whether a customer is likely to buy a loan or not from a bank based on specific features and predicts the same when provided a new data. The project yielded an accuracy score of 89% .
