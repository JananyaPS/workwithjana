1. CAR PRICE PREDICTION PROJECT:
Car price prediction is a machine learning project that uses decision tree regression algorithm- a supervised learning method employed to predict the price of car when the features of the car were provided.
It is a simple and basic machine learning project created to understand the working of machine learning algorithm and data preprocessing steps in a detailed way.

2.CUSTOMER LOAN PREDICTION:
Customer Loan Prediction is a machine learning project employed using Logistic Regression algorithm- a supervised learning method which classifies whether a customer is likely to buy a loan or not from a bank based on specific features and predicts the same when provided a new data. The project yielded an accuracy score of 89% .

3.EMAIL SPAM CLASSIFICATION:
Email spam classification is a machine learning project which aims to classify the mails into spam or ham based on any classifier. The classifier used in this project is Multinomial Naive Bayes classifier and produced an accuracy of 97% in its classification. It also correctly predicted the category of 'spam' or 'ham' when given the new data as input.
