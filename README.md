1. CAR PRICE PREDICTION PROJECT:
Car price prediction is a machine learning project that uses decision tree regression algorithm- a supervised learning method employed to predict the price of car when the features of the car were provided.
It is a simple and basic machine learning project created to understand the working of machine learning algorithm and data preprocessing steps in a detailed way.

2.CUSTOMER LOAN PREDICTION:
Customer Loan Prediction is a machine learning project employed using Logistic Regression algorithm- a supervised learning method which classifies whether a customer is likely to buy a loan or not from a bank based on specific features and predicts the same when provided a new data. The project yielded an accuracy score of 89% .

3.EMAIL SPAM CLASSIFICATION:
Email spam classification is a machine learning project which aims to classify the mails into spam or ham based on any classifier. The classifier used in this project is Multinomial Naive Bayes classifier and produced an accuracy of 97% in its classification. It also correctly predicted the category of 'spam' or 'ham' when given the new data as input.

4.MINI PROJECT-01:
Data exploration is the primary technqiue in the data science. A dataset is explored through various visualizayion techniques and the required basic insights are extracted for further processing. In this project, given the ADIDAS Sales Dataset, data visualization and exploration were done and useful insights were drawn helpful to business firm.

SOCIAL NETWORK ANALYSIS:
Social Network Analysis is a part of machine learning and NLP techniques used to identify the network connections within the members of a group. The project is implemented on Zachary Karate Club Dataset to identify the connections and visualize it in the form of graph. Also, various measures of SNA such as degree centrality, closeness centrality and betweeness centrality were measured in this project.
