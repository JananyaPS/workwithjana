# WorkWithJana — Beginner & Foundational ML/Analytics Projects  
This repository is a collection of my **basic and beginner-level projects** created during my early learning phase in Data Science, Machine Learning, Deep Learning, NLP, and Data Analytics.  

It serves as an archive of how I started learning core concepts before moving on to advanced ML systems, ranking models, fairness analysis, deep learning forecasting, and large-scale analytics.

Each directory contains focused, hands-on practice projects that helped me understand the fundamentals of data preprocessing, supervised learning, neural networks, NLP tasks, and exploratory analysis.
