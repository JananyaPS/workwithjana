## 📘 Purpose of This Directory  

These projects were part of my **early practice phase**, helping me learn how to:

- Work with real datasets for the first time  
- Build confidence analyzing data step by step  
- Turn numbers into simple visual insights  
- Develop consistency and curiosity as a learner  

This directory represents my **starting point in data analytics**, before moving on to more advanced machine learning, ranking systems, forecasting, and fairness analysis projects.
