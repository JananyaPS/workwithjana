# NLP Basics  
This directory contains beginner level Natural Language Processing (NLP) projects developed during my early learning phase.  
The notebooks focus on understanding core NLP concepts such as text preprocessing, embeddings, sequence modeling, and simple transformer-based tasks.

## 📂 Projects Included

### **1. User Question Answering**
A foundational NLP project demonstrating how a model can answer user queries based on provided input text.

**Highlights**
- Implements basic text preprocessing (tokenization, cleaning)
- Uses embeddings or pretrained models to understand semantic meaning
- Answers user questions based on a given context passage
- Demonstrates how NLP models extract relevant information
- Helps build intuition for QA tasks used in search, chatbots, and conversational AI

**Concepts Learned**
- Tokenization and vectorization  
- Understanding context vs. query  
- Text similarity / embedding-based retrieval  
- Simple transformer or rule-based Q&A logic

### **2. Text Summarization**
A beginner project that generates concise summaries from longer text passages.

**Highlights**
- Demonstrates extractive or abstractive summarization techniques
- Uses NLP preprocessing methods to clean and structure text
- Shows how summarization models compress information
- Useful for news summarization, document reduction, and content recommendation

**Concepts Learned**
- Sentence ranking / keyword extraction  
- Sequence-to-sequence modeling fundamentals  
- Understanding how models detect important text  
- Evaluation using basic qualitative comparisons

## 🛠️ Tools & Libraries
- Python  
- NLP libraries (NLTK, spaCy, Hugging Face Transformers – depending on the notebook)  
- Pandas, NumPy  
- Jupyter Notebook

## 🎯 What I Learned
These projects helped me understand the core building blocks of NLP, including:

- How machines process human language  
- How Q&A systems retrieve and generate answers  
- How summarization models condense long text  
- How embeddings capture semantic meaning  
- Basics of transformer-style architectures  

These notebooks form the foundation for my later work in recommendation systems, ranking models, and advanced machine learning projects.

## 📘 Purpose of This Directory  
This directory represents my **starting point in Natural Language Processing**.  
The goal was to explore fundamental NLP tasks in a simple, hands-on way before moving on to advanced models and production-level ML systems.
