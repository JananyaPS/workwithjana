# Deep Learning Intro  
This directory contains two foundational projects demonstrating my early exploration of neural networks and applied graph analysis. These notebooks focus on understanding models, preparing data, and building intuition before moving into advanced ML and production-grade systems.

## 📂 Projects Included

### 1. **LSTM-Based Stock Market Prediction**
A beginner sequence-modeling project that uses **Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)** neural networks to predict stock price movements.

**Key Features**
- Uses **historical stock price data** fetched through `yfinance`
- Applies **MinMaxScaler** to normalize price sequences
- Builds a **Keras Sequential model** with Dense + LSTM layers
- Predicts next-day price movement based on previous closing prices
- Visualizes predicted vs. actual stock trends using Matplotlib

**Concepts Covered**
- Time-series modeling  
- Sequence windowing  
- Data normalization  
- LSTM architecture basics  
- Overfitting awareness and parameter tuning

### 2. **Social Network Analysis**
An introductory notebook demonstrating **Network Analysis** using `NetworkX`.

**Key Features**
- Builds and visualizes social graphs
- Computes degree, centrality, and connectivity metrics
- Explores graph structures and relationships
- Visualizes networks using Matplotlib
- Introduces concepts useful for recommendation systems and graph ML

**Concepts Covered**
- Graph theory foundations  
- Nodes, edges, degree  
- Centrality metrics  
- Clustering & connectivity  
- Network visualization
